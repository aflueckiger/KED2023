## Week 1: Introduction + Where is the digital revolution?

On the one hand, I present the goals and organization of the seminar. On the other hand, we look at some recent applications that give an impression of the fascinating prospects of computers in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital humanities (DH).

## Week 2: Text as Data

Computational text analysis comes with many challenges that are unique due to the fuzziness of natural language. In this session, we learn about its methodological foundation, and we conduct our first computational text analysis to understand how this translates into practice.

## Week 3: Setting up your Development Environment

The title says it all. We are getting ready for the practical part of the course: Programming. As the installation of Python and non-standard command-line tools may be tricky, we do this in class rather than doing it as homework. Moreover, I will also introduce some principles to organize research and jargon that guide your way in the programmer's brave new word.

## Week 4: Introduction to the Command-line

The command-line is a powerful tool at your disposal. It is the working horse for many data wrangling tasks. In this session, you learn the basics of shells and perform many operations by effectively substituting clicks on the screen with commands. Admittedly, it is not overly exciting at this stage, yet it is essential for more sophisticated automation later on.

## Week 5: Basic NLP with Command-line

Counting words is the most basic method to look at texts from a computational perspective. The command-line provides tools to quickly sift through a massive text collection to describe the use of words quantitatively. In no time, you can also take a systematic look at the word usage in context. Sounds like a Swiss knife for computational text analysis in social science? It certainly is.

## Week 6: Learning Regular Expressions

When working with text data, you spend a lot of time cleaning your documents and extracting some pieces of information. Doing this by hand is not only a pain but simply impossible when facing more than a few dozens of documents. Fortunately, a formal language named Regular Expressions allows writing expressive and generalizable patterns to match specific text. Using these patterns, you can systematically extract and remove any textual parts without missing a single instance.

## Week 7: Working with Data

To this point, you have acquired the skills to cut a document into pieces and, subsequently, to extract, replace, and count any textual elements. Unless you have interesting data, these tools are neat but of no greater use. Thus, we turn to relevant data resources for social science. Given you have plain text at hand, your tools cut through data like butter. For other formats like PDF or DOCX, we learn some remedies to convert them into plain text. Most notably, we perform optical character recognition (OCR) .

## Week 8: Ethics and the Evolution of NLP

Ethics is not just an abstract topic of Philosophy. Modern NLP is more powerful than ever before and, thus, embedded in many aspects of life. Unfortunately, it also exhibits severe and not yet well-understood bias that causes harm. With the recent *data-driven deep learning turn*, NLP overcame many theoretical limitations -- yet, this comes at a cost. It is our duty to better understand the working and impact of this technology.

## Week 9: Introduction to Python

It may come as a surprise that we start with Python in the ninth session only. As the folks say, Python is among the coolest programming languages, relatively easy to learn, and provides excellent NLP packages so that you don't have to implement everything yourself. All true as long as you have your data ready. In this session, we begin with an introduction to the basic syntax of Python. Starting with basics is a dry matter; however, it allows you to use third-party libraries and get a handle on more sophisticated NLP analyses.

## Week 10: Data Analysis of Swiss Media

Analyzing the media discourse from the past and the present has always been one of the most exciting approaches for the social science. Only recently, however, [Swissdox@LiRI](https://swissdox.linguistik.uzh.ch/#) has introduced a simple to use API to assemble and download comprehensive datasets of Swiss news media. In this session, we learn about the process of data curation and data analysis using the Pandas package.



## Week 11: NLP with Python

Python is the language of choice when it comes to advanced NLP. Have you ever wondered how the frequency of terms has evolved over the years? Or how the language differs between two groups whereby the groups may be formed by any metadata (people, organization, gender etc.)? In such an exploratory endeavour, using an interactive and visual mode is the most effective that complements basic statistics. In short, we finally arrived at the serious stuff in our journey. To make sure, you don't get lost in the forest of yet unknown terms you will also learn the jargon of NLP.

## Week 12: NLP with Python II + Working Session

In today's session, we continue our deep dive into NLP with Python. It is the last piece of our puzzle. During this course, you have learned about the entire workflow, from assembling datasets of documents to analyze their content and visualize your findings. As soon as you have a structured text collection along with basic metadata (e.g., publication date), you can take numerous perspectives to look at your data. At this stage, it is time to kick-off the mini-projects allowing you to work with your data of interest.

### Explore interactively: 1 August Speeches by Swiss Federal Councilors

As a matter of tradition, Swiss Federal Councilors give an official speech on the Swiss National Day. Simon Schmid (journalist at Republik), with the collaboration of Prof. Andreas Kley (Faculty of Law, UZH), collected many of these speeches and kindly shared the resulting dataset with me. The collection comprises 166 speeches, which is a multiple of the publicly available [here](https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/ansprachen-zum-nationalfeiertag.html){target="_blank"}.

The interactive visualization linked below shows how the language differs between speakers of *Social Democratic Party of Switzerland* (SP) and speakers of other parties. The top right corner shows terms that have been frequently used by all parties. In contrast, the top left and the lower right corner reveal words that have been used primarily by the members of the SP and correspondingly by the centre-right parties. 

You can search for the terms of your interest. Moreover, you may click on the points in the plot to show the context of the corresponding words within speeches. These functions allow for a quick investigation of the corpus along the dimensions of Swiss parties.

## Week 13: Mini-Project Presentations + Discussion

In this session, it is your turn. Going beyond mere toy examples, you present what you have worked on and show off your first harvest of computational text analysis. 

The seminar is coming to an end, yet it doesn't have to be a dead-end. You may have gotten more proficient in cursing your computer but also fighting your way through the jungle of technology. Keep going, cheers!
